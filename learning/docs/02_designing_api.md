# Desiging a FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python framework for building APIs, leveraging type hints for automatic validation, documentation, and speed. It's async-ready and generates OpenAPI docs out of the box.

### Why use BaseModel?
1. Automatic data validation
2. Data parsing and conversion
3. automatic API documentation
4. structured responses
5. editor support and type safety
6. nested and reusable models
